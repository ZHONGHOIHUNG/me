TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In week 8, we were still focusing on the open data project that will be submitted and present in class before week 12. In the lecture this week we went through briefly about some sources to collect data for analysis, and where to process the data in places such as Jupyter notebooks and Excel. As well as the mapping for the open data project. In the tutorial this week I have changed my datasets again, since I find out that there arenâ€™t any noticeable fluctuations in population between Germany and France from 1910 to 1950 during the first and the second world war. Also the datasets might not be reliable, since the population records were hard to trace back in 1910-1950 especially in countries such as Germany and France during the world wars periods. Therefore I changed my datasets to be Hazardous waste treated or disposed of in different countries over time from 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014. I have mainly recapped the overall contents that I have learnt about python from the previous week and prepared for the assessment in week 9 this week.
