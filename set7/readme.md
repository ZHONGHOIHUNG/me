TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In week 7 we were mainly focusing on the open data project which will be submitted in week 11 as mentioned in the week 3 section of design computing github. In the lecture we have mainly gone through some brief explanations and tutorials on how to apply “Pandas” on the selected datasets for the data project in VSCode, which could be found in week 4 section of design computing github as well. In the tutorial this week we haven’t really gone through new stuff, each student was focusing on the data project individually. I have downloaded the data introduction file from the course folder for application of “Pandas” in the data project. Sadly the data that I have gathered last week was too limited for later analysis in this project, since there aren’t recognizable and obvious changes in the population and economy of both Ukraine and Russia, the range is too short as well. I was suggested to change data sets within a longer range for data analysis. I therefore changed and confirmed my new topic of this project to the analysis about populations and economic change in countries that were involved in world war 2, and to compare population and economic data before, during and after the war.
