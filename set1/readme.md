TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I wasn’t able to attempt both the lecture and tutorial of the course this week, due to renewing my ID in China. However, I have an overview of week 1 from the course website and from the course introduction videos I have realized the importance of this course to lay a better foundation for future computational design courses or even future careers. Through the guidance of lab activities, I managed to sign up for a git account and have all the necessary websites prepared, as well as uploaded zid and my name onto the design computing website. 
The process of learning to update my profile on the design computing website wasn't as smooth as the steps shown. I repeated the process and stuck in “git push” over 20 times and it didn't work until I received assistance from my friend who has successfully updated his profile. Through this experience, I have realized which step I missed and understood the difficulty of the course.
