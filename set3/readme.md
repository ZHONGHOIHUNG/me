TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In week three make up we recapped about taking things out from the list in week 2, and went through the testing function. In my understanding from the tutorial, the testing functions are basically using any number but to get the correct result regardless of the number used in the testing, this function only tells whether the answer was correct or wrong. Another thing we went through was pseudo code, which is to simplify complex things into a concept, such as building an abstract code that can fit into many situations. Lastly, I have also gone through some shortcut functions which I have already watched but not familiar with on week 2’s video.
In the course website I have gone through videos recapping about F strings on set 2 and debugging functions. Also learnt about new syntax, “in” and “try/except”. “in” is a testing function allowing whether something is inside a given range. In my understanding from the video “try/except” is a function to keep the program running while errors occur. Lastly, I have gone through the explanation on the function of different algorithms in khan academy.
