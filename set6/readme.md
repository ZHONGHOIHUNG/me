TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Week 6 is a flexible week, there isn’t any formal lesson taking place this week. However, there was a python tutorial arranged by instructor Ben on teams. Through this tutorial I have fixed the “wordy_pyramid” in set 4. This week I have gone through and recapped about exercises from previous previous sets, and retried them in another separate file to prepare for the assessment on week 8, I have also continued on with the last two questions on set 4. I have also gathered and organized data sets to prepare for the upcoming open data project. I have gathered the data sets about the population from 2020 to 2023 in Russia, Ukraine and individual cities' population specifically that are involved in the conflict. I have also looked up the economic shift in Russia and Ukraine about the GDPs, however the latest data sets updated in the website was in 2021, which was out of date and can’t match up with the population, and couldn’t make analysis for impacts on the economy from the war. However, I am able to gather those economic status in 2022 and 2023 from other places on the internet.
