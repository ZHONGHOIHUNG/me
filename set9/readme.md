TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Week 9 was the assessment and we didn’t have lectures this week. The assessment was an open book assessment therefore I went back and recapped codes from previous exercises when I got stuck during the assessment. In which I found the last question to be the most challenging question throughout the whole assessment, since I haven’t learnt codes that are capable of solving it, even with chatgpt. Other than the last question, the remaining tasks are just fine with the assistance from notes from previous tasks.
