TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In week 5â€™s lecture, we went through and learned about the brief background history of early coding systems and related persons that made contributions to early calculation systems at different stages of the history. We also looked at the application of digital modelling software on developing complex structural designs that require highly accurate data sets of scale, which can barely be achieved through hand drawing. In the tutorial, we have started lessons on input and output in Python and have gone through the IOexamples file in the set4 folder. The examples cover creating a json file, writing to the json file, opening and closing of the json file, the "with" block function, which basically helps manage files safely, as well as dumped strings and loads strings.
Lastly, to reflect on my studies this week, I have gone through previous exercises again to become more familiar with those codes. In the exercise of the week, I learned how to get the information wanted out from another file using "read()" and "loads()". I also managed to import requests and use get(url) to import information from the internet; however, I am still a bit stuck in this exercise and still having some troubles in the wordy_pyramid part.
