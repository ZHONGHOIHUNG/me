TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In the lecture and tutorial this week we have gone through the definition and application of some core concepts such as values, variables, expressions, functions, collections, flow control, and iteration in Python. We have also learnt abstraction, which simplified the process of dealing with irrelevant data. It showcases only the important information for the user.
From week 2’s lab, I have learnt the use of different brackets and when to use each of them, however, I haven’t memorized the functions of each of them thoroughly yet. Still having confusion when applying different brackets in set 2 exercises. I have also gone through videos and have learnt to use the debugger to test whether my code is correct in the exercise and how git generally functions. Also went through VS code shortcuts pdf, although I didn’t memorize much.
From the exercises this week I found the engineering flowchart in exercise 3 to be one of the most challenging activities. I struggled and have tested similar commands in difficult arrangements for 2 days and finally got the correct answer, and still don't understand the way it functions. 
The rest exercises seem to be fine after watching the answer videos.
